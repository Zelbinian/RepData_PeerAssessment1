# Setup

Before analysis can be done, we have to load in and clean up the data. At this point all we need to do is make a separate data set that omits the na values. (We keep both data sets so we can use each one as needed.)

```{r}
data <- read.csv("./activity.csv")
data_no_NAs <- data[complete.cases(data),]
```

# Analysis Questions

## What is the mean number of steps taken per day?

This histogram shows the rough distribution of how many days had a rough step count, which provides context for the summary statistics that follow.
```{r}
stepsEachDay <- with(data_no_NAs, tapply(steps, as.factor(date), sum, na.rm = TRUE))
hist(stepsEachDay, main = "Number of days with each step count", xlab = "Steps", ylab = "Days")
summary(stepsEachDay)
```
